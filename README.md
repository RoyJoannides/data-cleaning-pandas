# Quest Brief
You will initially examine the Shark Attack dataset, understanding its structure and formulating a hypothesis or several hypotheses about the data. 
For example, you might hypothesize that shark attacks are more common in certain geographical locations, or among individuals engaging in particular activities.
If you want to go further, you could even define a Business Case, such as “As a company that sells diving trips, I want to suggest destination for shark spotting”, or 
“ As a company that sells surf experiences or surf boards, I want to know where to set up a new shop and avoid shark attacks”.
Throughout the project, you’ll utilize Python programming and the pandas library to implement at least five data cleaning techniques to handle issues such as missing values,
duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies. Once the dataset is cleaned, you’ll use basic exploratory data analysis to validate your initial hypotheses and extract meaningful insights.
